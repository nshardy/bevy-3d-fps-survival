> I need to make a better name later on

This project is mainly to better my understand of [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.com/), along with creating a multiplayer game I can play with my family.
I have no clue how often this will be updated, but I will try to keep it up to date.

Dependencies:
```toml
bevy = { version = "0.13.2", features = ["default_font"] }
bevy-inspector-egui = "0.24.0"
bevy_quinnet = "0.7.0"
```
